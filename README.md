# Property Price Prediction Model with NLP and FastAPI
This is a web application deployed in Heroku using FastAPI Framework that predicts the price of a property based on certain features of the property using machine learning.

## Features
The app takes in the following features of the property as input:

- Location: The location of the property
- Area: The total area of the property in square feet
- Number of bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the property
- Number of bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the property
- Age of property: The age of the property in years
- Type of property: The type of property (apartment, house, etc.)
- Distance to nearest public transportation: The distance to the nearest public transportation (in miles)
- Distance to nearest shopping mall: The distance to the nearest shopping mall (in miles), etc.

Machine Learning Model
The app uses a machine learning model to predict the price of the property based on the above input features. The model has been trained on a dataset of properties with known prices and features.

The model uses a combination of ensemble linear regression to make its predictions. The model has an accuracy of 85% on the test dataset.
